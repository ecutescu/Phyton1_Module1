Comments are chunks of text that are written above, below, alongside, etc. lines of code within a cell that is marked as \"Code\" (or in command mode). These chunks of text will be visable to you, but will NOT be executed as part of the rest of the code. Basically, you are marking your code with commentary -- for your own understanding or to allow someone else reading your code to better understand what you were doing. Get into the practice of writing descriptive comments along with all of your code. While you are learning variaous skills, it will be invaluable for you to notate the purpose of each section of code. Throughout the course lessons, you will find valuable information in the comments that I include in my code. \n",
